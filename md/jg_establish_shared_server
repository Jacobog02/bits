# Background

I am making VM's shared by multiple users.

I need a way to share files and junk across multiple users

https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/12842/make-all-new-files-in-a-directory-accessible-to-a-group

The example must be run for each user that wants to use the same VM. 

I tried to move files between VM's and noticed that the account is owned by the google account (the one that your laptop uses when you do things like gcloud compute ssh in gcloud Command Line Interface)

# Example 

```

## Create the common group to add all users
sudo groupadd satpathy

## Confirm its there 
grep satpathy /etc/group

a_user=jacobog ## change for new users 

## Add a satpathy group as the primary for a user 
sudo usermod -g satpathy jacobog ## Concrete example 
#sudo usermod -g satpathy $a_user ## Automated approach

## Throw the previous main group back as secondary 
sudo usermod -a -G jacobog jacobog 
#sudo usermod -a -G $a_user $a_user

## Make hidden files change owners away from the google admin whatever. 
sudo chown -R jacobog_stanford_edu:jacobog_stanford_edu .
#cd $a_user ## Go into dir
#sudo chown -R $a_user:$a_user . ## dot is required to force hidden


## Allow Group Read/Write and force all new files to be in main group
## The `-R` arg forces all existing files and dirs to have the new permissions. 
sudo chmod -R g+rwxs jacobog
#sudo chmod -R g+rwxs $a_user



```
