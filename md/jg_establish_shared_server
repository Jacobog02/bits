# Background

I am making VM's shared by multiple users.

I need a way to share files and junk across multiple users

https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/12842/make-all-new-files-in-a-directory-accessible-to-a-group

The example must be run for each user that wants to use the same VM. 

# Example 

```

## Create the common group to add all users
sudo groupadd satpathy

## Confirm its there 
grep satpathy /etc/group

a_user=jacobog ## change for new users 

## Add a satpathy group as the primary for a user 
sudo usermod -g satpathy jacobog ## Concrete example 
#sudo usermod -g satpathy $a_user ## Automated approach

## Throw the previous main group back as secondary 
sudo usermod -a -G jacobog jacobog
#sudo usermod -a -G $a_user $a_user


## Allow Group Read/Write and force all new files to be in main group
## The `-R` arg forces all existing files and dirs to have the new permissions. 
sudo chmod -R g+rwxs jacobog
#sudo chmod -R g+rwxs $a_user

```
