## About

Useful commands in `git` that I can never seem to remember but are very useful.

## Unstage commit

If one tries to commit a file > 100 Mb limit in [GitHub](http://www.github.com), 

```
git reset HEAD~
--remove file--
rm LARGEFILE
--git ignore large file--
vi .gitignore  # then modify
git add -A
git commit -m "fixed large file commit"
git push
```
