## Handling a job that's suspended on LSF

If `bjobs` yields a job that's suspended--

```
JOBID   USER    STAT  QUEUE      FROM_HOST   EXEC_HOST   JOB_NAME   SUBMIT_TIME
253030  cl322   SUSP   big        rgs13       cn031       *vl-3.TCGA Jul 16 16:54
```

The fastest/easiest thing to do (assuming resources are now available) is--

```
brequeue 253030
```

## Get full file path set of files

```
find `pwd` -name *_2.fastq.gz
```

## Index many sorted .bam files / simple loop in bash

```
for f in *.bam; do samtools index $f; done
```

## Delete all files with less than 1000 lines 

```
find . -type f -exec awk -v x=1000 'NR==x{exit 1}' {} \; -exec rm -f {} \;
```

## Change all .bam files to .sam files and then compress them with missing header

Assumes that you have a `header.sam` floating around

Change all `*.bam` files to `*.sam` files
```
for f in *.bam; do mv -- "$f" "${f%.bam}.sam"; done
```

Change all `*.sam` files to `.bam` files using compression

```
for f in *.sam; do cat ../header.sam $f | samtools view -b -  > "${f%.*}.bam"; done
```

This is less painful if you don't butcher your `.sam` file without its header.
