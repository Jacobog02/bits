## Handling a job that's suspended on LSF

If `bjobs` yields a job that's suspended--

```
JOBID   USER    STAT  QUEUE      FROM_HOST   EXEC_HOST   JOB_NAME   SUBMIT_TIME
253030  cl322   SUSP   big        rgs13       cn031       *vl-3.TCGA Jul 16 16:54
```

The fastest/easiest thing to do (assuming resources are now available) is--

```
brequeue 253030
```

## Get full file path set of files

```
find `pwd` -name *_2.fastq.gz
```

## Index many sorted .bam files / simple loop in bash

```
for f in *.bam; do samtools index $f; done
```
